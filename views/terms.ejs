                    <h1>EQUIPSHARE TERMS OF USE</h1><br>
                    <p>The following terms and conditions (the “Agreement”) govern all use of the www.EQUIPSHARE.in website (the “Site”) and the services available on or at the Site (taken together with the Site, the “Service”). The Service is owned and operated by Agnihotri Business Consultancy Pvt Ltd. (“ABC”). The Service is offered subject to your (the “User’s”) acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Site by ABC. BY USING OR ACCESSING ANY PART OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE.

                            ABC reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement at any time. It is User’s responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes. User’s continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.
                            
                            User represents and warrants to ABC that: (i) (a) User is at least 18 years of age or older or (b) User represents an organization on whose behalf User is authorized and able to enter into a binding contract; (ii) all registration and Rental information User submits is complete, accurate and truthful; and (iii) User will maintain the completeness, accuracy and truthfulness of such information. User also certifies that User is legally permitted to use and access the Service and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of and access to the Service.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>SCOPE</h3>
                        <p>The Service is a neutral venue where renters of construction equipment (“Renters”) and owners of construction equipment (“Owners”) can allocated via optimized algorithms to each other and arrange for rental(s) of Owners’ construction equipment (“Rentals”). As a neutral venue, ABC maximize but cannot and does not guarantee or ensure (i) the form, fit, function or condition of any Rentals, (ii) the safety, or legal or regulatory compliance of any Rentals, or (iii) the acts or omissions of any Renters or Owners (such as the treatment of Rentals by Renters or the timeliness of delivery by any Owners). Any and all communications, or correspondence, verbal or written, or any warranties or representations, made by Renters or Owners are not made by (and do not legally bind) EQUIPSHARE, but rather are made specifically and solely by the applicable Renter/Owner. EQUIPSHARE may – but is not obligated to - pre-screen or prequalify any Renters or Owners (including with respect to verifying ownership of Rentals, maintenance of proper licenses, verification of insurance, etc.).</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>MASTER RENTAL AGREEMENT</h3>
                        <p>EQUIPSHARE is neither a lessor nor a lessee of any equipment. In the absence of another agreement, the rental terms provided here (see attached documents) shall govern the terms of any Rental made through the Service, and such terms, together with the Rental description on the Website and these Terms of Use shall constitute the entire agreement between such Renter and Owner regarding the relationship between such Renter and Owner regarding the applicable Rental. In the absence of an agreement otherwise, for bare rentals, the master equipment rental agreement shall apply, and for operated equipment, the master equipment rental agreement – operated equipment shall apply. A Renter and an Owner may create and use their own rental terms and/or modify the rental terms provided here (see attached documents) (in either case, their “Rental Agreement”) to suit their needs and their particular situation. ABC is not a party to the dealing, contracting and fulfillment of any Rental between a Renter and an Owner. All rights and obligations of a Renter or an Owner in their Rental Agreement are solely between such Renter and Owner. ABC serves only as a platform for the purpose of facilitating payments between Renters and Owners.

                                Any Renter shall disclose to the Owner project specific requirements, such as the applicability of prevailing wage laws that may apply to any proposed or actual transaction involving Renter and Owner.</p>


                            <br>
                            <h3>DISPUTES BETWEEN RENTERS, PEERS, OWNERS AND OTHER USERS.</h3>
                        <p>User is solely responsible for User’s interaction with other Service users (e.g. payment obligations). ABC reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between User and any other Service users. Because ABC is not the agent of either User or any other users, ABC will not act as an agent to User or in connection with resolving any disputes between such participants related to or arising out of any transaction conducted via the Site or the Service. If User has a dispute with one or more other users of the Service, User shall and hereby does release ABC (and its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, employees and investors and their related entities) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If User is a India resident, User waives Indian Civil Code §1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor." To the extent ABC assists in the resolution of any dispute between User and any other user, such assistance is only a courtesy and, therefore, User acknowledges that ABC shall not be liable or otherwise responsible with respect to such dispute (or the resolution thereof).</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>CHANGES TO THE SERVICE</h3>

For clarity, User will not re-rent or otherwise sell the Services. ABC may change, suspend or discontinue the Service, including the availability of any feature, database or content, at any time. ABC may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict User’s access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>SERVICE CONTENT</h3>

                                            User is responsible for all of User’s activity in connection with the Service. Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity may be grounds for termination of User’s right to access or use the Service. User may not post or transmit, or cause to be posted or transmitted, any communication or solicitation designed or intended to obtain password, account, or private information from any other user of the Service.

                                            User understands and agrees that ABC shall have the sole right to decide whether User is in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in this Section, and shall have sole discretion regarding the course of action to take in connection therewith.</p>

                                            <h3>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</h3>
                                            <p>ABC has no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to User. User acknowledges that ABC has no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding: which users gain access to the Service; what Content User accesses via the Service; what effects the Content may have on User; how User may interpret or use the Content; or what actions User may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content.
